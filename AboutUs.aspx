    <h3>About Us</h3>

    <p>
    At Science for Skin, we have developed several products to help relieve the symptoms of dry, irritated skin types. 
    Johanne holds a PHD in chemistry, and James a BSc in Bioscience and an HND in beauty therapy science. 
    Together we have devised a formulation based on existing scientific research in the field. Aware of the sensitive 
    nature of these conditions, we have based our formulation on natural, additive free ingredients.</p> 
    <p>
    We have researched current products for such dry and have found the market to be lacking in an effective, science based solution, 
    that is free from the irritants which can worsen irritated skin.</p> 

    <h3>Products</h3>
    <p>
    We have developed both a cream and an oil, which can be used separately, or together for maximum effect. Our cream is a luxurious 
    mixture of vegetable oils and waxes, water, essential oils and a gentle preservative. The cream should be applied two to three times 
    daily, or as required. Our oil consists of vegetable and vitamin e oils, and essential oils for scent and therapeutic effect. The oil 
    is great for scalp application, and for application on the body underneath the cream. Many users report great results from using the 
    oil after the bath or shower, and leaving overnight.</p>
